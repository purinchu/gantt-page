# gantt-page

Not much to see here, just trying to make a page that will help me generate
some Gantt-style diagrams we use in PowerPoint just a little bit easier.

It uses D3.js and pretty much nothing else.  No data leaves the web page, so
the gantt chart that is generated is completely on the browser side.
